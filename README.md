# Projecting Heat-Stress Vulnerable Populations at Intra-Urban Scales

DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.12165386

This repository provides the data and scripts necessary for full reproduction of results, as well as example datasets that were used for data generation and analysis in the manuscript Marginean et al., "High-resolution Modelling and Projecting Local Dynamics of Differential Vulnerability to Urban Heat Stress".

The folders in this repository contain the following:
1) The input datasets:
   - shares of educational attainment in 2012 and 2020, by sex, age group and census tract
   - internal migration by sex, age group and census tracts
   - decadal mortality and fertility, by sex, age group, scenario, and census tract
2) Projected decadal data (2012 to 2050) by sex, age group, scenario and census tract
3) Scripts for generating high resolution projections for three Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs): one script for SSP 2 projections and one scripts for SSP 1 and SSP 3 projections
4) Example input data to reconstruct the projections in SSP 1, 2 and 3 for females ages 25 to 64
